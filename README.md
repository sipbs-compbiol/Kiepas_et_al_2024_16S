```

## Set Up

We strongly recommend to create a `conda` enviroment specific for this activity. For example, if you have cloned or downloaded the repository and navigated to its root directory, the commands below should set up an appropriate environment:

```bash
conda create --name streptomyces python=3.8 -y
conda activate streptomyces
conda install --file requirements.txt -y
```

You will need also to install the following software within the environment, and follow the installation instructions are appropriate for each program:

- [pyANI v0.3](https://github.com/widdowquinn/pyani)
- [nextalign v0.1.4](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/tag/nextalign-0.1.4)
- [Cytoscape v3.9.0](https://cytoscape.org)

Due to repository size limits at `GitHub` we are unable to provide the complete set of 16S sequences and genomes used in this manuscipt in this repository. To access these FASTA and GenBank files you can access them on `Zenodo` at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10991761.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10991761), and place them in the appropriate directories. NCBI refernce taxonomy is also available from `Zenodo`.


- The 16S sequence data used in this study are also available from  [Greengenes v13.5](https://gg-sg-web.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/downloads/greengenes_database/gg_13_5/gg_13_5.fasta.gz), [SILVA v138.1](https://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/release_138_1/Exports/SILVA_138.1_SSURef_tax_silva.fasta.gz), [RDP v11.5](http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/download/current_Bacteria_unaligned.fa.gz) and the NCBI under BioProject [PRJNA33175](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=33175%5BBioProject%5D+OR+33317%5BBioProject%5D). However, it is possible that more recent downloads may not contain exactly the same sequences as used in the manuscript. Once the sequences are dowloaded from `Zenodo`, please unzip all files, and place the content of `supplementary_file_2_raw_16S_databases` into `supplementary_file_2`
- The genomes used in this study can be downloaded using the `download_genomes.sh` bash scipt provided in `supplementary file 17`. To ensure reproducibility, we strongly recommend to verify the accession IDs provided in supplementary file 2 and supplementary file 17 to confirm that the datasets match, and particularly that no extra sequences have been included in the download, before conducting analyses. Once the genome sequences are downloaded from `Zenodo`, please unzip all files, and place the content of `supplementary_file_17_NCBI_streptomyces_genomes` into `supplementary_file_17/data`.
- NCBI refernce taxonomy was downloaded from [https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdmp.zip](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdmp.zip). As this is a life document for the reproductibility sake we enourage to download the file from `Zenodo`, and place the contetnt of `supplementary_file_6_NCBI_taxonomy` into `summplementary_file_6`.
